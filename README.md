# Algorithm Kata

![kata](https://media.giphy.com/media/liJ0yOFmARUK4JpDiZ/giphy.gif)


A place to practice algorithms and data structures in public.

## Intention

This is an effort to fill in any gaps in my knowledge. My goal is to leave breadcrumbs for myself to help rebuild intuition for various data structures and algorithms.

## Structure

I've grouped these various algorithms and data structures into various patterns. This is subject to change. There's a test file for each leaf folder that will run all of the files in a special folder called: `kata`.
